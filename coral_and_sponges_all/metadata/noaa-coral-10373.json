  "studyNotes" : "This dataset contains coral-derived sea-surface temperature \n(SST, via Sr/Ca) and salinity (SSS, via the oxygen isotopic \ncomposition of seawater or d18Osw) reconstructions from \nPalmyra Island of the Line Islands chain in the central \ntropical Pacific, for the period 1886-1998. Cobb et al. [2001] \npresented the century-long coral oxygen isotopic (d18O) record \nfrom Palmyra, and here we present the century-long Sr/Ca and \nd18Osw records from Palmyra. The late 20th century portion of \nthe Sr/Ca and d18Osw records was presented in Nurhati et al.[2009]. \nWe measured coral d18O values on a GV Isoprime-Multiprep mass \nspectrometer with an analytical precision of ± 0.05‰ (1sigma), \nand Sr/Ca ratios with a Jobin Yvon Ultima 2C Inductively \nCoupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) with \nan analytical precision of ± 0.07% or ± 0.006 mmol/mol(1s) \nusing the nearest-neighbor correction method from Schrag [1999]. \nWe used the monthly 1ºx1º IGOSS SST dataset [Reynolds et al., 2002] \nto calibrate Sr/Ca ratios via reduced major axis regression, \nwhere (SST)palm = 130.43 – 11.39 x (Sr/Ca)palm (Nov 1981-Mar 1998; \nR=-0.71; CI > 99%). We derive the oxygen isotopic composition of \nseawater (d18Osw) by subtracting the Sr/Ca-derived SST contribution \nfrom coral d18O following the method outlined in Ren et al. [2003]. \nFairbanks et al. [1997] find an empirical linear relationship \nbetween d18Osw and SSS in the central tropical Pacific, so we use \nthe d18Osw records to reconstruct SSS variability associated with \nchanges in the hydrological balance. \n\nNote:\nCoral d18O data has been previously published by Cobb et el. (2001). \nSr/Ca data from 1981-1998 was used for the Sr/Ca-SST calibration. \nCoral d18O, Sr/Ca-derived SST and d18Osw data from 1886 to 1998 \nwere used in the trend calculations reported in the paper.\n\n",

    "abstract" : "Accurate projections of future temperature and precipitation \npatterns in many regions of the world depend on quantifying \nanthropogenic signatures in tropical Pacific climate against \nits rich background of natural variability. However, the \ndetection of anthropogenic signatures in the region is \nhampered by the lack of continuous, century-long instrumental \nclimate records. This study presents coral-based sea-surface \ntemperature (SST) and salinity proxy records from Palmyra \nIsland in the central tropical Pacific over the 20th century, \nbased on coral Sr/Ca and the oxygen isotopic composition of \nseawater (?18OSW), respectively. On interannual timescales, \nthe Sr/Ca-based SST record captures both eastern- and central- \nPacific warming \"flavors\" of El Niño-Southern Oscillation \n(ENSO) variability (R=0.65 and 0.67, respectively). On decadal \ntimescales, the SST proxy record is highly correlated to the \nNorth Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO; R=-0.85), reflecting \nstrong dynamical links between the central Pacific warming \nmode and extratropical decadal climate variability. \nDecadal-scale salinity variations implied by the coral-based \nd18OSW record are significantly correlated with the Pacific \nDecadal Oscillation (PDO; R=0.54). The salinity proxy record \nis dominated by an unprecedented trend towards lighter ?18OSW \nvalues since the mid-20th century, implying that a significant \nfreshening has taken place in the region, in line with climate \nmodel projections showing enhanced hydrological patterns \nunder greenhouse forcing. Taken together, the new coral records \nsuggest that low-frequency SST and salinity variations in the \ncentral tropical Pacific are controlled by different sets \nof dynamics, and that recent hydrological trends in this region \nmay be related to anthropogenic climate change. \n",
