    "abstract" : "North Atlantic climate variations are reflected in sedimentary records \nfrom the northern Indian Ocean in which two basins, the Arabian Sea \nand the Bay of Bengal, are strongly affected by the monsoon. Contrary \nto the Bay of Bengal the Arabian Sea plays an important role in the \nglobal marine nitrogen cycle. In its mid-water oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) \nbioavailable fixed nitrogen is reduced to nitrogen gas (NO3- -> N2), \nwhereas oxygen concentrations are slightly above the threshold of \nnitrate reduction in the OMZ of the Bay of Bengal. A coral colony \n(Porites lutea) growing south of Port Blair on the Andaman Islands \nin the Bay of Bengal was studied for its response to changes in the\nmonsoon system and its link to temperature changes in the North Atlantic \nOcean, between 1975 and 2006. Its linear extension rates, d13C and d18O \nvalues measured within the coral skeleton reveal a strong seasonality, \nwhich seems to be caused by the monsoon-driven reversal of the surface \nocean circulation. The sampling site appears to be influenced by low \nsalinity Bay of Bengal Water during the NE monsoon (boreal winter)\nand by the high salinity Arabian Sea Water during the SW monsoon \nin summer. The high salinity Arabian Sea Water circulates along with \nthe Summer Monsoon Current (S-MC) from the Arabia Sea into the Bay of \nBengal. Decreasing d18O and reconstructed salinity values correlate to \nthe increasing SSTs in the North Atlantic Ocean indicating a reduced\ninfluence of the S-MC at the sampling site in the course of northern \nhemispheric warming. During such periods oxygen-depletion became \nstronger in the OMZ of the Arabian Sea as indicated by the sedimentary \nrecords. A reduced propagation of oxygen-depleted high salinity \nArabian Sea Water into the Bay of Bengal could be a mechanism \nmaintaining oxygen concentration above the threshold of nitrate \nreduction in the OMZ of the Bay of Bengal in times of global warming. \n",
