# Description and Notes: 
# Cores Fiji 1F and Fiji AB were drilled from Porites lutea colonies within 200m of each other. Fiji core 1F was collected in April 1997 in Savusavu Bay, Fiji. A 2.3 m coral core was recovered from a P. lutea colony growing at a depth of 10 m in the middle of Savusavu Bay on the south side of the island of Vanua Levu, Fiji (16°49'S, 179°14'E). Fiji core AB was collected in December 2001. Fiji core AB is 3.89m long continuous coral core from a colony of Porites lutea growing at 10 m depth in Savusavu Bay, Vanua Levu, Fiji (16°49'S, 179°14'E) (within 200 m of core 1F collected in 1997). METHODS SUMMARY For both Fiji 1F and Fiji AB coral slabs 7 mm thick were cut from the cores and cleaned in deionized water in an ultrasonic bath and with a probe sonicator. Dry slabs were sampled with a low-speed micro-drill along tracks parallel to corallite traces as identified in X-ray positives with a 1 mm round diamond drill bit. The X-ray collage for Fiji 1F was published in Linsley et al. (2004). Sr/Ca was measured at 1 mm resolution (12â€“13 samples per year) and d18O was measured at 2 mm resolution on the same samples (analyzing every other sample or 6â€“7 samples per year) in both Fiji cores. We measured oxygen isotope ratios on a Micromass Optima gas source mass spectrometer at the University at Albany-State University of New York with an individual acid reaction vessel system. External precision was better than 0.05 per mil for d18O based on analyses of 657 (13.5%) replicate samples. We used an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectro-photometer (ICP-AES) at Harvard University to measure coral skeletal Sr/Ca in Fiji core 1F following a technique described in detail by Schrag (1999). The external precision is better than 0.15% (RSD) based on analyses of replicate samples (10% replicates). Fiji 1F Sr/Ca data was further corrected by -0.14 mmol/mol to adjust for lab offset with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory ICP-OES where Sr/Ca was measured on other cores in Dr. Linsley's collection. To construct the Fiji 1F and AB chronologies we tied the annual minima in Sr/Ca and/or d18O to February (on average the warmest month) and maximum Sr/Ca and d18O to August/September (on average the coolest months). Thus there were 2 tie-points per year. To generate the annual averages we then averaged all data with each calendar year. All mm-scale data.

#  Abstract: The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is the largest and most persistent spur of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. At the southeastern edge of the SPCZ near 170W and 15 20S a surface ocean salinity frontal zone exists that separates fresher Western Pacific Warm Pool water from saltier and cooler waters in the east. This salinity front is known to shift east and west with the phase of the El NinËœo Southern Oscillation. We have generated subannually resolved and replicated coral oxygen isotopic time series from Fiji (17S, 179E) and Rarotonga (21.5S, 160W) that have recorded interannual displacements of the salinity front over the last 380 years and also indicate that at lower frequencies the decadal mean position of the salinity front, and eastern extent of the SPCZ, has shifted east-west through 10 to 20 of longitude three times during this interval. The most recent and largest shift began in the mid 1800s as the salinity front progressively moved eastward and salinity decreased at both sites. Our results suggest that sea surface salinity at these sites is now at the lowest levels recorded and is evidence for an unprecedented expansion of the SPCZ since the mid 1800s. The expansion of the SPCZ implies a gradual change in the South Pacific to more La Nina-like long-term mean conditions. This observation is consistent with the ocean thermostat mechanism for the Pacific coupled ocean-atmosphere system, whereby exogenous heating of the atmosphere would result in greater warming in the western Pacific and a greater east-west surface temperature gradient.

#   Abstract: The Earth’s climate system is driven by a complex interplay of internal chaotic dynamics and natural and anthropogenic external forcing. Recent instrumental data have shown a remarkable degree of asynchronicity between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations, thereby questioning the relative importance of internal versus external drivers of past as well as future climate variability. However, large-scale temperature reconstructions for the past millennium have focused on the Northern Hemisphere, limiting empirical assessments of inter-hemispheric variability on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we introduce a new millennial ensemble reconstruction of annually resolved temperature variations for the Southern Hemisphere based on an unprecedented network of terrestrial and oceanic palaeoclimate proxy records. In conjunction with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction ensemble, this record reveals an extended cold period (1594–1677) in both hemispheres but no globally coherent warm phase during the pre-industrial (1000–1850) era. The current (post-1974) warm phase is the only period of the past millennium where both hemispheres are likely to have experienced contemporaneous warm extremes. Our analysis of inter-hemispheric temperature variability in an ensemble of climate model simulations for the past millennium suggests that models tend to overemphasize Northern Hemisphere–Southern Hemisphere synchronicity by underestimating the role of internal ocean–atmosphere dynamics, particularly in the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere. Our results imply that climate system predictability on decadal to century timescales may be lower than expected based on assessments of external climate forcing and Northern Hemisphere temperature variations alone.

#  Abstract: In the Pacific Ocean, the coherent pattern of interdecadal variations in sea surface temperature (SST) over the last ∼100 years has been termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). To examine past variations in the IPO we have generated time series of Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes (δ18O) from South Pacific Porites coral colonies growing at Rarotonga (1997 to 1726) and Fiji (1997 to 1780). At both sites skeletal Sr/Ca is highly correlated with instrumental SST at least back to ∼1970 and δ18O appears to reflect both SST and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) effects on seawater δ18O. Comparison of our results to a New Caledonia coral δ18O record and to indices of interdecadal Pacific climate variability demonstrates that these South Pacific corals have accurately recorded twentieth century variations in the IPO and SPCZ. The coral records also indicate that higher amplitude and more spatially coherent IPO-related variability existed from 1880 to 1950 with notably poor between-site correlations in the mid-1800s. These observations suggest that the spatial IPO pattern in South Pacific SST was significantly more complex and/or poorly defined in the mid-1800s compared to that observed in the twentieth century. Comparison with North Pacific IPO indices also indicates that the degree of cross-hemispheric symmetry of interdecadal oceanographic variability has changed over time with a lower correlation between the North and South Pacific in the mid-1800s. This evidence suggests that the spatial pattern of the IPO at least in the South Pacific has varied over the last 300 years, with a major reorganization occurring after ∼1880 A.D.
