# Description_and_Notes
#	Description: Results of analysis of a core collected from a 'fossil' massive Porites coral exposed in the raised reefs of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea.  The coral grew about 38-40 ka BP, when sea-level was about 70-90 m below present day level.  The core was collected vertically down the axis of maximum growth of the colony.  This core was subsampled into 1mm growth increments, resulting in an average of 9 samples/annual growth increment.  These samples were analysed for d18O, then the data interpolated to seasonal resolution (presented here).  In this region, seasonal and interannual variations in skeletal d18O are due to the combined effects of changes in precipitation/evaporation balance and temperature; see Tudhope et al., 1995, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., 136, 575, and Tudhope et al., 2001, Science, 291, 1511-1517 for further discussion of climatic interpretation.

#       Abstract: The El Nin ̃o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most potent source of inter- annual climate variability. Uncertainty surrounding the impact of greenhouse warming on ENSO strength and frequency has stimulated efforts to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of ENSO to climate change. Here we use annually banded corals from Papua New Guinea to show that ENSO has existed for the past 130,000 years, operating even during “glacial” times of substan- tially reduced regional and global temperature and changed solar forcing. However, we also find that during the 20th century ENSO has been strong compared with ENSO of previous cool (glacial) and warm (interglacial) times. The observed pattern of change in amplitude may be due to the combined effects of ENSO dampening during cool glacial conditions and ENSO forcing by precessional orbital variations
