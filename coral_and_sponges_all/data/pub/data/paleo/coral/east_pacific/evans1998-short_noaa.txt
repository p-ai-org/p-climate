#	Description:  The following is excerpted from Evans et al.,  J.Geophys.  Res., in review,  1998 (please see this paper for references made in this readme file):  Proxy climate data derived from the isotopic composition and chemistry of  aragonite formed by massive reef corals provide a supplementary data set  for the study of the tropical near-surface climate [Cole et al., 1993;  Dunbar et al., 1994; Linsley et al., 1994; Tudhope et al., 1995; Charles et  al., 1997].  Given constant sea water o18 and biological processes,  variability in the oxygen isotopic composition (o18) of coralline aragonite  is a function of the sea surface temperature in which the coral secreted  its skeleton [Epstein et al., 1953; Weber and Woodhead, 1972; McConnaughey,  1989].  However, coral o18 also records changes in the o18 of sea water  [Cole et al., 1993; Linsley et al., 1994; McCulloch et al., 1994] if  freshwater flux variance is significant.  The Strontium:Calcium (Sr/Ca) ratio in corals has been shown to be a  function of sea surface temperature as well, with minimal sea water Sr/Ca  influence [Weber, 1973; Schneider and Smith, 1979; Beck et al., 1992;  DeVilliers et al., 1994; Shen et al., 1996].  Application of these two  proxy measurements in tandem has been used to distinguish sea water o18 and  sea surface temperature anomalies recorded on the Great Barrier Reef during  the 1982-3 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event [McCulloch et al.,  1994].  We made measurements of stable isotopic composition (o18 and c13) and Sr/Ca  on a coral collected live from Kiritimati (Christmas) Island (157.3 W, 2  N), in the Republic of Kiribati.  Kiritimati lies at the eastern edge of  the western Pacific warm pool and just west of the NINO3 box (Fig.  1).   The seasonal range of sea surface temperature (SST) is less than 1.2  degrees C. Because the seasonal cycle is modest, ENSO-induced warm and cold  phase sea surface temperature anomalies of +/-3 degrees C are prominent  [Bjerknes, 1969; Wyrtki, 1975; Wyrtki, 1985; Philander, 1990].  By  contrast, ENSO-driven precipitation anomalies are moderate in magnitude and  brief in duration, creating a minor change in sea water o18 due to enhanced  rainfall [Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987] and eastward advection of lower  salinity water [Picaut et al., 1996].  Thus, Kiritimati is an ideal  location from which to monitor the thermal signal associated with the full  ENSO cycle and should record features similar to those in the NINO3 region.  Data and Methods: Stable isotope data  Coral PP7-3 was collected live and cored at South West Point, Kiritimati  Island, at 9 meters depth in March 1994.  The coral has been identified as  Porites sp., probably P. australiensis, possibly P. lobata [D. Potts, UCSC,  pers.  comm.].  The core was slabbed along the growth axis and  X-radiographed for densitometry study; slabs were then ultrasonically  cleaned in de-ionized water and dried at 50 degrees C prior to sampling.   Samples for oxygen and carbon isotope analyses were drilled from the slab  at 0.5 mm intervals starting from just below the most recent growth and  extending to a maximum depth of 1004 mm.  A precise age model was  recoverable for the upper 839.5 mm.  Samples were drilled from lines chosen  parallel to the axis of maximum growth to avoid non-temporal (i.e.   potential differential growth-related) isotopic effects [McConnaughey,  1989].  X-ray diffraction analyses of drilled and chipped coral aragonite  verify that samples were 100% aragonite after drilling.  Sequential  isotopic analyses were made using a Finnigan MAT-251 gas source mass  spectrometer coupled to a Carousel-48 automated sample preparation device.   Measurement precisions (1-sigma) were +/-0.06 per mil and +/- 0.04 per mil  for o18 and c13 analyses, based on analysis of a lab standard; sample  replication over the 1981-1987 period (see section on Sr/Ca data below)  gives an external precision of +/- 0.09 per mil in the o18 time series  shown in Fig.  2.  All stable isotope measurements are reported relative to  the PDB standard.  We use the strongly periodic c13 record to provide an age model for time  series analysis of the o18 data.  The carbon isotopic composition of  coralline aragonite varies with seasonal changes in insolation,  reproductive activity, and changes in the c13 of [sigma CO2] of sea water  [Fairbanks and Dodge, 1979, Patzold, 1984, Gagan et al., 1994, Gagan et  al., 1996].  The carbon isotope record from coral PP7-3 (Fig.  2) shows a  series of regular c13 enrichments, which correspond to thin low density  bands.  These enrichments are probably too large to be explained entirely  by variability of c13 of sea water [ sigma CO2] [Swart et al., 1996] or to  be solely related to seasonal insolation variability [Fairbanks and Dodge,  1979].  However, a model which invokes the drawdown of carbon-12 within the  coral polyp by production of gametes during a brief period of each year, a  process called mass spawning [Babcock et al., 1986, Gagan et al., 1994;  Gagan et al., 1996], may explain the annual enrichments we observe in the  carbon isotopic record.  There are no published accounts of the timing of  mass spawning events in the central Pacific.  We assume that such events  take place in April of each year, at the onset of the April-September  insolation maximum at Kiritimati.  Intermittently in the PP7-3 record,  single years do not display a c13 enrichment, perhaps due to sub-optimal  coral reproductive conditions.  In these cases we use the same growth rate  as the previous and subsequent years to continue the age model, an  assumption consistent with an age model based on densitometric observations  (Figure 2, top) and relatively constant extension rate (Figure 4).  By  these criteria, the length of record extends from September 1993 back to  April 1938 (Figs.  2,4).  The high (0.5mm) sampling resolution enabled us  to obtain 25-35 samples per annual band and achieve a chronology with  biweekly to monthly resolution.  The chronology we construct is in good  agreement with annual age determinations based on X-radiography of the  sampled slab, and with an age model based on a constant growth rate  assumption (Fig.  4).  Uncertainty in such an age model might be expected to vary with time before  present; therefore a single error estimate for the entire time period is  unsatisfactory.  Since the timing of mass spawning at Kiritimati has not  been observed, we conservatively assume an initial age model error of +/-  1/2 year, and we estimate the age model error as a function of the absence  of the annual \delc\ chronometer.  The mean extension rate is 14 mm/yr,  with a standard deviation of 1.5 mm/yr (11%).  Therefore, we estimate age  model uncertainty for each year within the preceding five decades as (0.5 +  2*n*sigma(growth rate) years, where n is the number of years in that decade  in which the c13 enrichment is absent.  These errors range from +/-0.5 to  +/-1 year per year of age model (Fig.  4).  We believe that uncertainty in  the age model is well represented by these estimates.  Initially we derived  cumulative age model error estimates, but it was clear by this model that  these error estimates were too large in the earlier half of the record, and  too small in the more recent half.  A better error representation was  obtained with the error model below, which acknowledges that periods of  consistently periodic c13 pulses provides better age control than periods  with more intermittent reproductive activity.  Subsequent intercomparison  of the Kiritimati o18 record with the historical SST analysis by [Kaplan et  al.  1998] suggests our age model estimates are probably appropriate.  Data and Methods: Sr/Ca data  Sr/Ca may be the preferred proxy for the purpose of SST reconstructions,  since unlike o18, Sr/Ca variability is solely a function of SST. However,  since analysis of \delo\ is more easily automated, requires less sample  preparation and is 10-20 times faster than measurement of Sr/Ca by thermal  ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), we use limited, high precision TIMS  Sr/Ca measurements to confirm the interpretation of the Kiritimati o18 time  series as primarily driven by regional SST anomaly.  Based on the carbon  isotope age model, we resampled the 1981-1987 period (Fig.  3A).  Samples  were drilled at 1 mm intervals in a transect parallel to the line chosen  for the high resolution stable isotopic measurements described above.  The  samples created were split into two portions: one for replicate stable  isotope analysis and one for Sr/Ca analysis.  Stable isotope and Sr/Ca  sample sizes were 70-120 micrograms and 130-250 micrograms, respectively.   The replicate stable isotope measurements were used to verify the  chronology for the Sr/Ca data and to assess the reproducibility of the  oxygen isotope anomaly record.  Stable isotope measurements were made using  the previously described procedures.  Sr and Ca concentrations were  measured using the isotope dilution technique on a VG Sector thermal  ionization mass spectrometer, using enriched Sr-84 and Ca-43 spikes.   In-run isotopic fractionation was corrected using measured Sr-86/Sr-88 and  Ca-42/Ca-44 and an exponential fractionation law [Russell et al., 1978].   Duplicate or triplicate runs were made on each Sr/Ca sample and averaged.   The standard error (2-sigma) on the Sr/Ca measurements is less than +/-0.03  mmol/mol, based on internal precision, duplicate analyses, and replicates;  this translates into an SST error estimate of less than +/-0.5 degrees C.
