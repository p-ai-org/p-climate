# Abstract: This paper presents a 500 year March-August precipitation reconstruction for the Bavarian Forest region of southeast
#  Germany based on a composite, well-replicated data set of 676 living and historical tree-ring width series from Norway
#  spruce. Two versions of the chronology are developed. The cubic smoothing spline (SPL) chronology, standardized
#  with a fixed 80 year spline function, retains decadal and higher frequency variation. The regional curve standardization
#  (RCS) chronology uses regional curve standardization to retain additional lower frequency variation from the same
#  data. Calibration (1879-1978) of these chronologies with March-August precipitation indicates they explain 40% (SPL)
#  and 34% (RCS) of the variability in the instrumental precipitation record. The SPL reconstruction models the high frequency
#  variation better, whereas the RCS reconstruction tracks the low-frequency trends more robustly. It suggests
#  that spring-summer precipitation was above the long-term average for the periods 1730-1810 and 1870-2000, about
#  average between 1560 and 1610 and that significantly drier periods occurred during 1510-60, 1610-35, 1660-1730 and
#  1830-70. The low-frequency trends of the RCS reconstruction during the 19th century were verified by comparison with a
#  regional precipitation series derived from 14 long precipitation records from central Europe. Better verification results were
#  obtained using the original (non-homogenized) records over this interval. These results suggest that some low-frequency
#  variability may have been removed during correction of these early records. Periods of synchronous decadal variability
#  were observed between the SPL series and independent dendroclimatic reconstructions from central Europe. The RCS
#  reconstruction is the first dendroclimatic precipitation reconstruction in Europe to capture low-frequency information.
#  These long-term trends, however, are difficult to verify owing to the paucity of other proxy precipitation records in
#  central Europe that portray low-frequency information. Further verification and testing of the RCS reconstruction will
#  require the development of additional reconstructions from tree-rings (or other proxy data series) that similarly target
#  low-frequency variability.
